"""Is Gokuk installed? Asked by Gokuk at startup and by Setup for its cards.

Setup writes setup_state.json when it finishes. That file alone is not trusted:
a folder copied without its models, or a half-deleted runtime, would still
carry it. So the handful of files each component cannot work without are
checked too - quick existence checks, no hashing.
